This code implements a stock trading strategy based on a neural network. The script first opens a file selection dialog and loads the selected file into a pandas dataframe. The date column is then converted to datetime and set as the index of the dataframe. The code also prints the shape of the dataframe and the column names.

The close price of the stock is plotted using matplotlib. The 50-day and 200-day moving averages are calculated and added as new columns in the dataframe. The script then generates trading signals based on the moving averages.

The data is pre-processed using MinMaxScaler, and the data is split into training and testing sets. A neural network model is then defined, compiled, and trained using the training data. The script uses the trained model to generate trading signals for the testing data and calculates the accuracy of the signals.

Finally, the script creates a plot that shows the close price of the stock along with scatter plots for buy and sell signals. The plot is generated using matplotlib and shows the accuracy of the trading signals.
